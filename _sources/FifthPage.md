## Environmental Considerations

The dataset I am using here is a list of 200,000 Steam Video Game user behaviors, with user-id, game-title, behavior-name, value. The behaviors included are 'own' and 'play'. The behaviour I am interested in is 'play' as this is a numeric figure, representing how many hours the particular user has spent playing the games that they have purchased. I will be using this to create a derived rating score that the recommender system will then be able to use.

## Diversity within Team Structure

This approach to recommendation requires a lot of data about users’ preferences. Collaborative filtering doesn’t know anything about the content itself, it doesn’t attempt to analyse them at all. Instead it makes the assumption that if User A tends to give similar weights to content that User B does, they both enjoy similar content. Therefore, if User B likes content that User A has not been exposed to yet, it’s likely that User A will be happy to have that content recommended to them. This user preference data can either be explicit (the user actually rates the content) or implicit (analyse which content the user engages with most often and for long periods of time). Due to Collaborative Filtering’s reliance on user data, it suffers from what’s known as the “Cold Start” problem. Brand new users have no preference data, and so the system will always struggle to know what to recommend.
