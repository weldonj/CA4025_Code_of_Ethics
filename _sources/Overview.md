## OVERVIEW AND UNDERLYING MANTRA

Throughout the next five pages I list and describe ethical concerns that I feel are important across all stages of potential Data Science projects. I want to lay out an underlying mantra at this stage however, that I feel should always be present in the background. I want to borrow the hippocratic oath from the field of medicine, and specifically the term "First Do No Harm". 

While it's possible to conceive of certain circumstances where it may be worth causing some harm for an overall net good, I feel that in the vast majority of cases it should be fairly obvious if there is a clear harm associated with a proposed Data Science project or endeavour. I believe that in these cases, one should walk away and not partake. While this may be difficult in industry or similar where one has been instructed by their manager, they should really consider whether the company involved is somewhere they want to be working. 

I think if one approaches all of their Data Science work with this underlying mantra in the back of their mind, they can be more confident that the work they are doing is providing value with less chance of damage to individuals or society as a whole.

### Ethical Considerations

**Data Collection -**

In this section I lay out some considerations that I feel should be taken into account when collecting sensitive data.

**Data Analysis and Modelling -**

Here I discuss the ethics of the data analysis and modelling phase of a Data Science project.

**Data Storage -**

No matter how small or large a Data Science project is, there will always be data that needs to be handled at some stage. In this section I lay out some considerations when transfering and storing data and also the deletion of the data when finished.

**Team Structure and Environmental Concerns -**

Lastly I discuss ethical concerns regarding the ever growing carbon footpring produced by Data Science endeavours and also some thoughts on diversity in team structures.
