## Always be Honest with Results and Findings

When undertaking a Data Science project or task, one may already have a desired outcome in mind. If, having completed the work, the results do not support whatever hypotheses or outcomes were initially proposed or desired it is incredibly important that they still be accepted. The results and outcomes should not be dismissed, thrown out or manipulated/massaged to suit these original hypotheses. This is vital to the scientific method and a cornerstone of the ethics of science in general. 

## Limit Exposure of Personally Identifiable Information

If there are features in the data that can clearly identify an individual subject but isn't actually useful for analysis (Names, Social Security numbers etc.) these may be removed or hidden before the analysis begins. Each person can simply be assigned an identification number 1 through n (n being the count of subjects). There are also differential privacy methods that can be employed to ensure that no single subject can be identified in the data. 

## Ensure that the Work is Reproducible

The team may be tasked with explaining certain findings and even produce evidence to support these findings. Therefore, it is vital that everything be completely reproducible if necessary. This means that the team should be able to take the same original dataset, and trace back through every step that was taken to land at the same conclusions and outcomes. If they are unable to this, they cannot defend themselves from accusations of falsifying results and outcomes etc.
