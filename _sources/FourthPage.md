## Ensure Stored Data is Safe and Secure

The data being used in most Data Science projects will be private and sensitive. It's therefore imperative that it be encrypted where possible when being transferred and while not in use at all and at rest. There should be controls on who can access the data and how long they can access it for, and also logging systems in place to allow the monitoring access. Only those who actually need access should be granted it, and if they move off of the project they should lose access immediately. It should not be stored on local devices such as laptops, where possible, to avoid it being left in a public place or stolen.

## Plan for Eventual Deletion

There should be a plan in place for deletion of all sensitive data once the project is finished and it is no longer needed. If there is data on human subjects, they should be informed of when this deletion date will be at the start of the process if possible, and should be updated if this date has since been moved. New permission may be needed in order to keep the data for longer if the team want to use it for significantly longer than was communicated to the cohort.

## Create Simple Process for Subjects to Request Deletion

At any time within the process, if there are human subjects involved, a subject should be able to have their data removed from the project. It may be wise to create a process at the outset where they can easily contact the team to request this removal and the team can effortlessly remove this data quickly.
