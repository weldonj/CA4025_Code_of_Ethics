## Ensure to Obtain Informed Consent

For any project undertaken that includes human subject data, specific informed consent must be obtained from each individual involved. Everyone on the team should complete an ethics course in working with human subjects, such as CITI's "Human Research Data or Specimens Only Research" course[1].The subjects should be informed what data will be stored, used and for what reason. They should know how long the data will be kept for and whether it will be made public or kept private within the data science team. 

## Only Collect Data that is Relevant to the Proposed Project

While it may be simpler and more time effective to just collect a broad range of data points for each subject, the team should only collect data that will be explicitly used for the purpose of the proposed project. 

## Try to Ensure that the Data is Truly Representative

Unlike the previous approach, here the content being recommended is also closely analysed. It can be a lot more difficult to collect the data as it’s not at all easy to identify how the individual features relate to user preferences. Two main data categories are used in content based music recommendation systems. Metadata about the content, and also the content itself. For music as an example, this can be features such as beats per minute, what chords are played in the song, and even just how loud it is. One big advantage that content based filtering has over collaborative filtering is that it can be difficult to get users to actually rate content, whereas the content itself can often be freely analysed.
