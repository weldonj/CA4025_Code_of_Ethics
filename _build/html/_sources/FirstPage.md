## Ensure Informed Consent is Obtained

For any project undertaken that includes human subject data, specific informed consent must be obtained from each individual involved. Everyone on the team should complete an ethics course in working with human subjects, such as CITI's "Human Research Data or Specimens Only Research" course[1].The subjects should be informed what data will be stored, used and for what reason. They should know how long the data will be kept for and whether it will be made public or kept private within the data science team. 

## Only Collect Data that is Relevant for the Proposed Project

While it may be simpler and more time effective to just collect a broad range of data points for each subject, the team should only collect data that will be explicitly used for the purpose of the proposed project. If the scope of the project changes after the data has been collected and stored, any data that is now set to not be used should be deleted immediately as there is no longer any justification for having it. Likewise, if the scope of the project should change, the subjects should be informed of the changes and new informed consent may need to be obtained depending on the changes made.

## Try to Ensure that the Data is Truly Representative

Bias will almost always play a part when collecting data. While it may not be possible to eliminate it completely, efforts should be made to minimise its presence and impact. For example, if attempting to poll everyone in a certain population, a team should make sure to try and reach all ethnicities, age groups, genders, religions etc. The data will not at all reflect reality if there are far more men than women, or far more teenagers than septuagenarians, or far more black people than white people. While there are certain statistical methods to try account for skews in these ratios, nothing will beat getting a true, representative sample of the population. If this isn't possible for whatever reason, a data scientist must make sure that this is accounted for and documented or any analysis or modelling will be inherintly biased and misleading right from the get go. If the team or individual is simply given data and isn't collecting it themselves, they should examine it with the same thing in mind, and check for these skews.
