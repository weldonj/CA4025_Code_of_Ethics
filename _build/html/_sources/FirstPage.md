## Ensure to Obtain Informed Consent

For any project undertaken that includes human subject data, specific informed consent must be obtained from each individual involved. Everyone on the team should complete an ethics course in working with human subjects, such as CITI's "Human Research Data or Specimens Only Research" course[1].The subjects should be informed what data will be stored, used and for what reason. They should know how long the data will be kept for and whether it will be made public or kept private within the data science team. 

## Only Collect Data that is Relevant to the Proposed Project

While it may be simpler and more time effective to just collect a broad range of data points for each subject, the team should only collect data that will be explicitly used for the purpose of the proposed project. If the scope of the project changes after the data has been collected and stored, any data that is now set to not be used should be deleted immediately as there is no longer any justification for having it. Likewise, if the scope of the project should change, the subjects should be infomred of the changes and informed consent may need to be obtained once more depending on the changes made.

## Try to Ensure that the Data is Truly Representative
