## Consider the Environment

Researchers at the University of Massachusetts found that an average, off the shelf deep learning model can emit over 626,000lbs of Carbon Dioxide[1]. This was the equivalent of the lifetime emissions of 5 average family cars, including their manufacture and delivery. Data Science has so far, for the most part, taken the approach that the more compute that one can get their hands on, for the longest possible time, the better the results will be for whatever deep learning that needs to be performed. There is a growing field of research that attempts to reduce this colossal carbon footprint by being more specific and precise when training these models. Going forward it seems that any large Data Science project would need to address these concerns in some way in order to be deemed ethical in terms of potential environmental damage.

## Create Diverse Teams

While there is a continuing push to improve the diversity within the field of Data Science, current estimates are that between only 15% and 22% of all Data Science professionals are women[2]. It's not only the gender ratio that is skewed. In 2017, a look at 20 campuses across the globe showed that almost 50% of all Data Science students were white, with 28% being Asian, 8% Hispanic and only 4% African-American[3]. While there are certain things that may not change significantly (more men may simply prefer to enter these fields than women, for example) it's clear that these ratios are not at all representative of the general population. I feel that, wherever possible, it would be most ethical for a team that is working on Data Science projects to contain individuals from the widest possible range of backgrounds and identities. Even putting ethics aside, this seems likely to improve the quality of the project as there will likely be more unique viewpoints and ways to approach the tasks at hand.
