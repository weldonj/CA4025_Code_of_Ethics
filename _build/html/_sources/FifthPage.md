## Diversity within Team Structure

While there is a continuing push to improve the diversity within the field of Data Science, current estimates are that between only 15% and 22% of all Data Science professionals are women[1]. It's not only the gender ratio that is skewed. In 2017, a look at 20 campuses across the globe showed that almost 50% of all Data Science students were white, with 28% being Asian, 8% Hispanic and only 4% African-American[2]. While there are certain things that may not change significantly (men may simply prefer to enter these fields than women, for example) it's clear that these ratios are not at all representative of the general population. I feel that, wherever possible, it would be most ethical for a team that is working on Data Science projects to contain individuals from the widest possible range of backgrounds and identities. Even putting ethics aside, this seems likely to improve the quality of the project as there will likely be more unique viewpoints and ways to approach the tasks at hand.
