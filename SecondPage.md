## Always be Honest with Results and Findings

When undertaking a data science project or task, one may already have a desired outcome in mind. If, having completed the work, the results do not support whatever hypotheses or outcomes were initially proposed or desired it is incredibly important that they still be accepted. The results and outcomes should not be dismissed, thrown out or manipulated/massaged to suit these original hypotheses. This is vital to the scientific method and a cornerstone of scientific ethics.
